# DocuScope LAT rules db json generator

A tool for generating the json database to be used the with the DocuScope
tagger.

# DISCONTINUED

Though this tool works efficiently, the results were not useful at this time.
If the LAT rules were to be imported to some records based database for use,
then this would have been useful. However, the large size of the file and the
amount of post-processing needed for the tagger means that this does not
help at this time.
